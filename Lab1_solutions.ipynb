    "1. The null hypothesis is that there was no change in average liquor consumption. State\n",
    "this formally in terms of m.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis is that there is no change in liquor consumption.\n",
    "$$H_0 : \\mu = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The alternative is that there was a decline in liquor consumption; state the alternative\n",
    "in terms of m.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "$$H_1 : \\mu < 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, suppose your sample size is n  900 and you obtain the estimates y  32.8\n",
    "and s  466.4. Calculate the t statistic for testing H0 against H1; obtain the p-value for the test. (Because of the large sample size, just use the standard normal distribution tabulated in Table G.1.) Do you reject H0 at the 5% level? At the 1% level?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: This is an example of large sample Test for Population Mean. It is one tailed test where test statistics is give by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T.S. = z-score= \\sqrt(n)*\\frac { \\bar(y) - \\mu_0 }{s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now s = 466.4 and n = 900 \n",
    "\n",
    "So $$ \\frac {s}{\\sqrt(n)} = 466.4/30 = 15.55$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to sample size , we assume standard normal distribution so $$\\mu = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $$T.S. = 30 * \\frac{ \\bar(y) - 0}{466.4}$$\n",
    "    $$T.S. = 30 * \\frac{ -32.8 - 0}{466.4}$$\n",
    "    $$T.S = -2.11$$\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Z<= -2.11)  = 0.0174\n",
    "\n",
    "Now P value is greate than 0.05 so we will reject the Null for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when compared to 1% i.e. value 0.01 , it's slightly more so we can not reject NULL here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Would you say that the estimated fall in consumption is large in magnitude? Com- ment on the practical versus statistical significance of this estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "5.What has been implicitly assumed in your analysis about other determinants of liquor consumption over the two-year period in order to infer causality from the tax change to liquor consumption?\n",
    "\n",
    "Annswer: Other social-economic factors such as divorce rate/premature deaths/layoff's ( which shows correlation to one's alcohol consumption) are constant across 2 years.\n"
